# Bernklang

The sounds of the city of Berne, Switzerland.

## Notes

- Fade-In Time: 1s
- The Audio file should at least be 20 seconds long.

## Tools

I record my audio with the phone app [ASR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.asr&hl=en&gl=US).
It is important to set the audio source to the "camera mic", or otherwise the telephone mic will be used, which
has a much lower quality.

For the coordinates, I use [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/).

## Development

The usual:

```js
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
